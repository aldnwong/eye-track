# Eye-Track Experiment
This experiment serves as the testing grounds of an effect I want to implement into a new version of my [portfolio](https://aldenw.ong) website.
This person tracks the position of the mouse relative to the location of the person's eyes.
The person will open their eyes wider if the mouse gets close to them, and has an animation to hide when toggled.
This is a barebones version of the final product just to try and make a proof of concept before moving on to creating the full portfolio website.
